## Skills

#### Dynamic Reservoir Simulation

•	Subsurface (Reservoir Engineering): Construction of dynamic reservoir model for risk analysis and field optimization to reduce overall costs: 
o	Identified project primary uncertainties and possible reserves through development of a dynamic reservoir simulation for Ntomme Field expansion. 
o	Economically evaluated of model to determine feasibility and impact of planned future drilling campaign by performing further sensitivity analyses. 
•	Subsea (Facilities Engineering): Construction of future water injection network system and implementation of possible failure analyses on subsea infrastructure to recommend a solution that was cost effective without sacrificing reliability of system:
o	Validated design of current water injection network by consolidation of large amounts of FPSO data with subsea instrumental pressure and flow data from snapshot multi-flowmeter readings.
o	Explored and improved expansion scenario for system debottlenecking and uptime which lead to improvement and identification of main system constraints (riser pressure) to increase production. 

#### Production Forecasting

•	Preparation for budget approval & external audits for all fields in business unit (Espoir and Ezanga Fields) to improve reserves base accuracy:
o	Updated quarterly forecasting by interpretation of large amounts of production and operations data.
o	Prepared for yearend budges/external audits by coordinating with finance team to swiftly deliver new wells approvals, book reserve submissions and update drilling schedule under changing deadlines and workload.

#### Database Management
•	Data management systems for all fields in business unit for ease of access and interpretation for YE Budgets and updates to forecasts: 
o	Maintenance of SQL scripts for data storage and ease of extraction for senior colleagues.
